"""Deterministic stand-ins for the three LLM nodes (LLM=fallback). Same output types as the LLM.

Ranker: score every catalog cause on the evidence the ranker is given (residual sign, field
notes, the M1 call, the shape of the shift, measurement quality). Channel geometry is *not* used
here on purpose: it is the skeptic's cross-check, so the two nodes look at different evidence.
Causes whose expected sign contradicts the residual get confidence 0. datum_change and
inconclusive are always listed. A skeptic objection demotes the objected cause and promotes the
one the skeptic suggested.

Skeptic: object when the top cause's expected sign contradicts the residual, or when the channel
geometry contradicts it (speed fell much more than area changed -> something is holding the
water back, i.e. fill/backwater on the downstream control, not a datum change or scour).
