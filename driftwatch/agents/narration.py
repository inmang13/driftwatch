"""Narrator facts, the fixed sentences built from them, and the narration guard.

Every number and every claim the narrator may use is computed here, in code, from the triage
facts and the evidence tools. The LLM only arranges these into prose; the fallback template in
fallbacks.narrate uses the same sentences. Channel area and velocity are evidence only: they feed
the cross-check sentence and are never used to predict flow.

The guard (check_text) enforces the hard rules on any narration text: banned words and patterns,
the 200-word cap, the closing "Rating confidence N/100 (Band)." sentence, and the open-cause rule
(no mechanism words in DriftWatch's own conclusion; the field note's meaning and a cached lead are
labelled sentences, so they are stripped before that check).
