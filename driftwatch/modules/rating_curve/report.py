"""Snapshot -> Report for one gauge: pairing, base rating, drift test, trust score, likely cause.

The likely cause here is the deterministic triage call (no LLM). The agents in M2 refine it.

Two sets of measurements, on purpose:
- visits (`visits_since_reference`): every paired gauging from the reference start on, including
  the Helene-excluded flood gaugings and invalid_domain ones. A visit is a visit: these drive
  staleness, the 12-month data count, and field-note flags / note-based causes.
- tested (`segmentation.tested_measurements`): the drift-test series. Helene-excluded and
  invalid_domain gaugings stay out; it drives the fit, the drift test, the recent residual and
  the recent quality grade.
