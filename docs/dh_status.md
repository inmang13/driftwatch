# DH status: round 2 DONE (2026-11-07, 14:22); round 1 DONE 14:00

Branch `pi/dh-test`, pushed. It is based on `main` at d30143c (after PR #9). No PR is open; Grace merges.
Built in a separate worktree (`/srv/arx/work/dw-dh`), so the shared checkout at `/srv/arx/work/driftwatch` (on `pi/m1`) was not touched.

| Step | State | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Two residual series, larger standardized step, `low_flow_concentrated` | done | f5fe1a1 |
| 2. Poor out of the search, quality-weighted median shift sizes | done | 1373437 |
| 3. `suggested_shift_ft` / `suggested_shift_n` (provisional) | done | 2857cdf |
| 4. `reference_mode` fixed / auto, 8 gauges run both ways | done | 3c27159 |
| 5. Tests, `make test`, `make demo`, results doc | done | 971d6c2, 7942b5a |

- `make test`: 113 passed (96 before; 17 new).
- `make demo`: green offline. The fallback verdicts are the same as on `main`.
- Results: docs/dh_results.md. Decisions: docs/decision_log.md, entries "dh 1" to "dh 4".

## Round 2
- Magnitude gate max(10, 1.5 × reference MdAPE), applied to both series; failing change points are merged.
- Auto reference = the most recent stable period ending at least 8 measurements before the latest one. The ≥ 15 measurements over ≥ 2 years floor is kept; that was a judgment call. The holdout is recorded in the Report.
- Eno null rerun at 20 / 40 / 80 visits: 18 / 40 / 56 % without the gate, 2 / 8 / 12 % with it.
- `make test` 117 passed; `make demo` green.
- **Open for Grace:** the auto rule turns Swannanoa, Watauga and Eno Stale, because it falls back to decades-old windows (docs/dh_results.md, Surprise 1). A suggested fix is in that doc but not built.

## Files touched
`driftwatch/modules/rating_curve/{segmentation,report,pairing}.py`, `driftwatch/core/schemas.py` (fields added only), `tests/test_segmentation.py`, `tests/test_report.py`, `docs/decision_log.md` (appended), `docs/dh_results.md`, `docs/dh_status.md`. Nothing under `driftwatch/agents/` or `driftwatch/api/`.
**Outside the list:** `reports/*.json`, regenerated for all 8 gauges. `make demo` rewrites two of them in any case. They are in their own commit (971d6c2) and can be dropped.

## For Grace
1. **Auto mode is one gauging from flipping Newport.** Its post-Helene period is 14 gaugings over 1.97 years, against a requirement of 15 over 2. After the next visit, auto would take the new channel as the reference and stop seeing the shift. Should auto be capped at the fixed reference end, or at the Helene date?
2. Change 2 makes the Eno null fire a little more often at long series: 40 % at 40 visits, up from 34 %. Not retuned.
3. `reference_mode` can be set only through `build_report(...)`. The CLI and the API were outside this job's files.
4. The pre-existing ruff error in `driftwatch/modules/registry.py` (TRY004) was left alone.
